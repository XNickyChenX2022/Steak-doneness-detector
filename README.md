# Steak Doneness Classifier
# I.Abstract
Steaks are a global culinary delight, with millions consumed annually. The art of cooking a steak plays a pivotal role in shaping its texture and overall dining experience. Unfortunately, many steaks have met the unfortunate fate of being overcooked beyond redemption. Some, however, have been daringly undercooked but still find their way to the table. Preferences for steak doneness vary widely, yet a significant portion of the global population leans towards the medium-rare spectrum. In an innovative approach, this classifier employs images sourced from quick Google searches and Roboflow to categorize steaks solely based on their visual appearance into six distinct doneness levels: blue rare, rare, medium rare, medium, medium well-done, and well-done.
# II.Introduction
In the course of my life, I've savored numerous steaks, each a delicate balance of perfection when done rightâ€”tender and juicy. Yet, there are instances where steaks end up overcooked, resulting in a disappointingly chewy experience. Personally, I align with the medium-rare preference when it comes to steaks. This project stems from my encounters with overcooked steaks, often courtesy of my mother's culinary adventures, and aims to shed light on the nuances of steak correctness. The misconception that medium steak equates to rawness has been a recurring theme, highlighting the need for a more accurate understanding of steak doneness. My own lack of expertise in precisely identifying the doneness of a steak has prompted me to the expertise of online sources. This classifier seeks to harness that collective knowledge to distinguish and categorize steak doneness more effectively than personal assessments might allow.
# III. Materials and Methods
The majority of the dataset came from state islamic university bandung from roboflow. However, some images were derived from direct google searches. The sum of these two google searches became the dataset for this project. Aside from these images, this classifer did not require any other images. 
# IV. Data Preprocessing
To ensure that steaks are properly labeled, I manually looked through the images to determine which steaks were incorrectly labeled. I did not remove steaks that I had a hard time distinguishing. Images without the cross section of the steak and images with lots of clutter were also removed. Then image augmentation was applied to ensure that there were enough examples. After the said augmentation, The images were rescaled for training and then split into a training, validation, and test set.
